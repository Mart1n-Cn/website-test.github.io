About me

Hi, Welcome to my website!

This is a test webpage for myself to learn how to make an academic webpage. All the information is made up, please don’t take it seriously :)

I’m a fourth year Ph.D student from NSD, Peking University. My research interest includes environmental economics, health economics, and development economics.
